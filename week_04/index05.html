    <section class="introduction">
      <p>Choosing an acupuncturist can be overwhelming, especially if you’ve never had acupuncture before.  It’s important to ask some questions before you book an appointment for an acupuncture treatment to make sure you’re getting the right practitioner for your particular needs.  The following are some important points to consider and ask a practitioner before you book your first appointment, to help you choose the right one</p>
      
      <h3>Education counts—know your practitioner’s education and licensure</h3>
      <p>This is an important first question to ask anyone before they perform acupuncture on you!  All too frequently consumers are led to believe that any practitioner who is trained or certified to practice acupuncture is highly qualified in the art of diagnosis and treatment using the principles of Chinese Medicine.  Don’t hesitate to ask a prospective practitioner about their credentials and training.</p>
      <p>Physicians performing acupuncture are required to have 100-200 hours of training in the technical use of acupuncture prior to using it as a treatment.  This is considered medical acupuncture.  If you are considering medical acupuncture, look for a doctor who is a member of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, which requires a minimum of 200 hours of training in acupuncture for membership.</p>
      <p>Many chiropractors advertise that they offer acupuncture.  It is important to know, however, that depending on which state you live in, they may only be required to have 100 to 150 hours of unspecified training in acupuncture.  They typically take a test sponsored by their local Chiropractic Board and pay a fee to become “certified”.  Chiropractors who perform acupuncture call themselves Board Certified Acupuncturists.  In addition, they are usually legally limited only to performing acupuncture treatments that augment chiropractic adjustments.</p>
      <p>Licensed Acupuncturists (LAc) are required to have a minimum of 1,800 to 2,400 hours or more of education and clinical training, depending on individual state requirements.  In most states they must also be certified with the NCCAOM, a national regulatory agency governing Oriental Medical education and credentials.  Licensed Acupuncturists are also licensed by their state’s Board of Medical Practice.</p>
      <p>Licensed Acupuncturists practice internal Chinese medicine, which focuses on the underlying source of the problem, rather than just treating symptoms.  As a result, their treatments go beyond simple pain relief offered by most chiropractors and medical acupuncturists.</p>
      <p>Most Licensed Acupuncturists must also have a Masters degree in either Acupuncture of Oriental Medicine.  The distinction between the two is that a practitioner with a Masters in Acupuncture is trained primarily in acupuncture.  A practitioner with a Masters in Oriental Medicine is trained both in acupuncture and diagnosis and treatment using traditional Chinese herbs.</p>

      <h3>Find out your practitioner’s area of specialty and experience with your condition</h3>
      <p>Some acupuncturists treat any and all conditions.  However, many specialize in treating certain conditions, such as muscle and joint pain, stress and anxiety, infertility, or women’s conditions.  It is important to ask whether a prospective practitioner has had some experience in treating your condition.  It is also important to ask what kind of results a practitioner has had with your particular condition.</p>
        
      <h3> It’s all about style—ask about the kind of acupuncture being practiced</h3>
      <p>Most people don’t know that there are many different kinds of acupuncture, such as Traditional Chinese acupuncture, Ear acupuncture, Japanese style, Korean Hand acupuncture, cosmetic acupuncture, and scalp acupuncture.  Some of these different kinds of acupuncture are more effective for specific conditions.  For example, Ear acupuncture is especially successful for addictions, such as quitting smoking and weight loss, and scalp acupuncture might be more valuable for conditions affecting the nervous system.  Be sure to ask what conditions are best helped by your practitioner’s kind of acupuncture.</p>
      
      <h3>Find out about the number and frequency of treatments</h3>
      <p>No practitioner should tell you how many acupuncture treatments you will need on the phone before they have seen you, taken your health history and made a diagnosis.  In fact, everyone heals at a different pace.  Your condition may be resolved in one or two treatments, or it may take many more, especially if it is a long-term chronic condition.</p>
      <p>Acupuncturists may vary in their frequency of treatments.  Some prefer to treat you weekly, and others may prefer to see you more than once a week.  In general, acute conditions may require more frequent treatments, and chronic, long-standing conditions may be treated less frequently.</p>
      
      <h3>Check out what treatments other than acupuncture are offered</h3>
      <p>Beyond acupuncture, there are a number of other kinds of treatments that come under the umbrella of Chinese medicine, and it’s important to ask what, if any, other kinds of treatments a practitioner offers.  Many Licensed Acupuncturists are also credentialed herbalists, and can prescribe herbal formulas to address your particular condition.  The herbs may come in the form of small pills, capsules, teas, powders, and raw herbs that must be cooked.  Herbal medicine is a good way to augment your acupuncture treatment, and can be tailored to your specific needs.</p>
      <p>Many acupuncturists provide help in the form of food therapy.  They can help you incorporate foods into your diet that are most beneficial to your particular conditions.  In addition to food therapy, some practitioners incorporate lifestyle counseling into their treatments.</p>
      <p>Other treatments that may be offered include bodywork, heat therapy, and cupping, which involves creating a vacuum in a glass cup on your skin to aid in pain relief and other conditions.</p>
      
      <h3>Find out if your health insurance pays for acupuncture treatments</h3>
      <p>Many health care plans currently don’t pay for acupuncture treatments.  As a result, many acupuncturists are fee for service providers.  If you think your health insurance plan may cover acupuncture, check with them to be sure.  Make sure the acupuncturist you ultimately choose will accept your insurance as payment or provide you with a receipt so you can be reimbursed by your health plan.</p>
      <p>If you have a health savings plan, acupuncture qualifies for reimbursement.  In addition, acupuncture qualifies under most Flexible Spending Plans.  Be sure to ask your acupuncturist for a detailed receipt after your visit.</p>
      
      <h3>Don’t be afraid to ask about cost</h3>
      <p>The price of an acupuncture treatment will vary based on the experience of a practitioner, their style of acupuncture, and the city in which you are located.  For example, acupuncturists in larger cities tend to charge more than those in smaller towns.  Be sure to ask a practitioner what they charge, both for initial treatments and for follow-up visits.</p>
